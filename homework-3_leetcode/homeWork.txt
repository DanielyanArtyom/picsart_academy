(Maximum subarray sum can be solved as the problem with stocks, assuming you already got differences between stocks.
So imagine you have already diffed results, and you should find the maximum profit.
The solution at the class without any indices is a valid solution for this problem. 
Notice that in the problem 121(best time to buy and sell stock) we found the solution without subtracting the values)).
Analyse and keep track of each iteration.  Follow the both algorithms step by step on the paper. Both are very important.
